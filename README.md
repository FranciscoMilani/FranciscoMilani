### Hi there 👋

I'm Francisco Milani, an aspiring tech enthusiast and former game developer, now transitioning into software development/quality assurance fields. I'm currently participating in a Industrial and Technological Development Scholarship program as a QA analyst, managing software testing processes at the Digital Games Quality Assurance Laboratory at the University of Caxias do Sul (UCS Lab QA).
